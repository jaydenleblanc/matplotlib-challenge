## The Power of Plots using Matplotlib

In this project, a dataset from a drug trial on 249 mice were analyzed to see how the different drugs used in the trial affected SCC tumor growth. Tumor development was observed and measured over 45 days under the administration of the drug of interest, Capomulin, compared to the other treatments. Tables and figures were brought together to create a top-level summary of the study results.

## Methods Used:
